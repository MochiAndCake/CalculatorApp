# CalculatorApp

Author: Ann Soong

The objective of this project is to create an android app that acts as calculator and a basic unit
converter.



User cases:

1. User enters "-1--1--1" into the calculator and enters "=", the display in the app shows that the
    sum is "1".

2. When the user clicks the "Undo" button, the app will display the text before the user's last
    input, unless the user's last input was cleared. However, the undo button will only undo one
    step.

3. When the user clicks on the "Convert" button if they have a number on the screen, the app will
    switch to the Unit Conversion screen. The number they had on the Calculator screen will appear
    on the Unit Conversion screen.

4. On the Unit Conversion screen, the user will see a drop down menu. The user will select an option
    and the original number and unit and the converted number and unit will be displayed.
