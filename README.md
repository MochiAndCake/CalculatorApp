# CalculatorApp

Author: Ann Soong

The objective of this project is to create an android app that acts as calculator.

User cases:

1. User enters "-1--1--1" into the calculator and enters "=", the display in the app shows that the
    sum is "1".

2. When the user clicks the "Undo" button, the app will display the text before the user's last
    input, unless the user's last input was cleared. However, the undo button will only undo one
    step.
